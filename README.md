# Showcase

## I want my portfolio to be retro looking in design. I have an idea of what I want it to look like later on.

### I am trying to showcase my skill so far in CSS as well as use of CSS selectors, ID's, and types of boxes I can create using what I've learned so far

#### Ultimately, this will be a work in progress for me, and I will keep updating this read me with what I have in mind for the future, especially art projects
